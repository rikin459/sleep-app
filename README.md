## Introduction 

Single-page web applications such are becoming in day-to-day tasks such as Google Maps being a single page web application. Most single-page web applications are made using react and firebase. For my project react and firebase was used to create my sleep app. The sleep app is designed to log your sleep which will help students who have a bad sleep schedule. The app contains a goal progress bar which allows the student to see in real-time how they're doing. The sleep app also has a weekly overview which shows how much they've been sleeping over the week this is great as it will motivate them to achieve their goals in sleep therefore the sleeping schedule can be improved.


The first part of this assessment was to do the research on what the problem is and identify it then it was time for some surveys to be done to find out the user’s point of view on this. A small prototype was also made in the first half of the project which was then feedbacked on by the potential users. The second part of the assessment focuses on mainly developing the actual application and creating it this was done by using JavaScript and react as mentioned above.

## Methods

When creating big projects, it's important to use methodologies for the first half of this project I use the design thinking methodology which helped me identify the user’s needs and create a prototype. however, it is important to also use a development methodology which will help you create the actor application when you come to that stage. So before building the application I decided to choose a methodology that would suit my project well and I decided to choose at the end the waterfall methodology. This methodology was split into five parts

1. Requirements: the first point of the methodology is required this is where you would gather the information on the requirements of your project for example for my project it would be the requirements of the user’s needs for example what they need in the app like sleep metrics.


2. Design: this would be where the first draft of designs is created and the final designs of the project. For our project the designs were created in Figma which is a tool that you can create prototypes. this was also done in the first half of the project.
 
 
3. Implementation: the implementation part of the waterfall methodology is where once those two steps are completed, we can move forward to the implementation part. In the implementation part, you would use the requirements and the design part of the project to create your project. for my project, I used the requirements of the users which I got from the survey and the design prototype which was made in Figma to create the actual application.

4. Verification and testing: this is part of the methodology once we have completed the implementation, we have a project. once the project is created one can stop the verification and testing of the project which will give great insights into improvements or any bugs if it's a software project. For my project once completing the project, I did some verification improvements and decided to test the project to see if every feature that I implemented is working.
 
5. Deployment and maintenance: lastly when the project is created deployment and maintenance will be the next step this means deploying the application of the project that you're working on and also maintaining it to keep it running. for my project I had to deploy the application which was done in this part of the stage also there were a couple of changes that I decided to make which we're done also at this point as they were fairly minor choices and changes.








## User Story 
A second-year uni student is struggling with his sleep schedule he struggles to go to sleep on time and wake up. This led to him having health problems such as tiredness low appetite and struggle to focus. He decides to use the sleep app to log his sleep every day and he also checks in on the app and it shows on the progress bar how well he's doing this motivates him to have a better sleep schedule and go to bed on time and get the full 8 hours of sleep. He also compares his sleep using the graph at the bottom of the app showing how he is doing with his progress of improvement which leads him to be better at his sleep overall

## Conclusion 
To get some feedback on my work I decided to ask my sister who goes to the university of Sussex to have a look at my single-page web application. the first point she made was the consistency of the colour theme used throughout the whole web application which is a black and purple colour scheme. it was also a great colour scheme to use as the application would be used before bed and harsh colours should be avoided before bed. she then described the logging process of the sleep which was very good but however she did say there is room for improvement in the logging the sleep page. The final thing she said was the homepage was the plus point of this project as it was full of information and sufficiently designed and the graph below looks visually pleasing and also as a function
